# GameLib

## What This Is

GameLib is a public fork of Heroic Games Launcher that adds Steam as a first-class supported platform. Where Heroic covers Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon Games, GameLib extends this with full Steam library integration — browse, install, and launch Steam games from the same interface. It targets gamers who want a single unified launcher instead of switching between clients.

## Core Value

One launcher that manages your entire game library across Epic, GOG, Amazon, and Steam — without needing to open Steam, Epic, or GOG separately.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] User can add and manage a Steam account in Manage Accounts
- [ ] User can browse their full Steam library from within GameLib
- [ ] User can install Steam games from GameLib
- [ ] User can launch Steam games from GameLib
- [ ] Steam games appear alongside Epic/GOG/Amazon games in the library view
- [ ] Steam authentication works reliably on Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Out of Scope

- Other new platforms (Ubisoft Connect, itch.io, Xbox) — Steam first, others later
- Replacing Steam client functionality (friends, community, overlay) — launcher use only

## Context

- **Upstream**: Heroic Games Launcher v2.22.0 (https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher)
- **Architecture**: Electron + React + TypeScript; store managers in `src/backend/storeManagers/` (gog, legendary/Epic, nile/Amazon, sideload)
- **Existing Steam touchpoints**: `steamgrid` (artwork fetching), `shortcuts/nonesteamgame` (add non-Steam games to Steam), Steam Deck detection — none of these are a Steam store manager
- **Why a fork**: Heroic maintainers are explicitly anti-Steam and will not merge Steam support upstream
- **Target audience**: Public distribution — gamers who want one unified launcher

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Must remain Electron + React + TypeScript to stay mergeable with Heroic upstream improvements
- **Compatibility**: Linux, macOS, Windows (same as Heroic)
- **Steam auth**: Approach TBD during research phase — Steamworks SDK, steam-user npm package, or browser-based login

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fork Heroic (not build from scratch) | Heroic already solves multi-store UI, download manager, game config, Linux/Wine — no need to rebuild | — Pending |
| Steam store manager follows existing pattern | `src/backend/storeManagers/` pattern is clean; new `steam/` directory keeps parity with gog/legendary/nile | — Pending |
| Start with Manage Accounts | Account auth is the prerequisite for everything else; unblocks library, install, launch | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
