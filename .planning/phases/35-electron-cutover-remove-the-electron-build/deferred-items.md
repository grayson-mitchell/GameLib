# Phase 35 — deferred items

Out-of-scope discoveries made during plan execution. Logged, deliberately NOT fixed.

## D-35-03-01 — `meta/i18nForkTouchedFiles.json` is stale against its live git derivation

**Found during:** plan 35-03, regression sweep of the `Meta` jest project.

**Symptom:** `meta/__tests__/genI18nGateScope.test.ts` fails one assertion —
`A-17 ANTI-ROT: the committed meta/i18nForkTouchedFiles.json equals the LIVE git derivation`.
The committed artifact lists three files the live diff against the upstream merge-base no
longer surfaces:

- `src/frontend/components/UI/PathSelectionBox/index.tsx`
- `src/frontend/screens/Library/components/CategoriesManager/index.tsx`
- `src/frontend/screens/Library/components/InstallModal/defaultPlatform.ts`

**Not caused by plan 35-03.** Plan 35-03 touched `vite.config.ts`,
`meta/__tests__/viteRendererConfig.test.ts`, `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`,
`.github/workflows/release-tauri.yml` and `src/backend/__tests__/releaseWorkflow.test.ts`.
None is a `src/frontend/**` file, and none appears in the failing diff. Verified by grepping
the failure's own diff output for this plan's file names — zero matches.

**Scope note:** the sibling assertions in the same suite pass, including
`A-17 ANTI-ROT non-vacuity: the anti-rot check DOES fail against a mutated copy` — so the
guard is working correctly and is reporting a real staleness, not misfiring.

**Fix when someone owns it:** re-run `pnpm gen-i18n-gate-scope` and commit the regenerated
artifact. Note MEMORY's `regenerating-an-artifact-breaks-the-pins-that-guard-it` before doing
so — regenerating this file has broken its own pins before.

**Status:** open, unowned. Consistent with MEMORY's standing note that the repo's i18n gate is
red repo-wide (`prettier-gate-is-red-repo-wide.md`).
