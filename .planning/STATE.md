## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Steam store manager follows `src/backend/storeManagers/` pattern (new `steam/` directory)
- Steam auth approach TBD: Steamworks SDK, steam-user npm package, or browser-based login
- Auth is prerequisite for all library and game operation phases

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Steam authentication approach not yet decided — must resolve before Phase 1 implementation begins
