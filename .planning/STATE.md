# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-26)

**Current focus:** Phase 02 — steam-library

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (steam-library) — COMPLETE
Plan: 6 of 6 (all complete)
Status: Phase 2 signed off (manual QA passed). Next: Phase 3 — Game Operations
Last activity: 2026-06-28 - Completed 02-06 manual QA checkpoint; LIB-01..04 verified on real Steam data

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 2)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Steam store manager follows `src/backend/storeManagers/` pattern (new `steam/` directory)
- Steam auth approach TBD: Steamworks SDK, steam-user npm package, or browser-based login
- Auth is prerequisite for all library and game operation phases
- [Phase ?]: No follow-up getSteamUserInfo call needed since auth flows return username inline
- [Phase ?]: No enabled/experimental guard per D-08 — Steam is always first-class
- [Phase ?]: Specific route placed before loginweb/:runner catch-all to prevent WebView capture
- [Phase ?]: pendingFetches.add() before await in fetchMetadataIfNeeded (T-2-03 dedup)
- [Phase 02-04]: Gate makeLibrary steam inclusion on steam?.username (not library length) for correct D-02 first-sync empty state
- [Phase 02-04]: steamLogin uses refreshLibrary({ runInBackground: true, library: 'steam' }) per D-01; blocking handleSuccessfulLogin removed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Steam authentication approach not yet decided — must resolve before Phase 1 implementation begins
