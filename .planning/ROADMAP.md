# Roadmap: GameLib

## Overview

GameLib forks Heroic Games Launcher and adds Steam as a first-class platform alongside Epic, GOG, and Amazon. The roadmap follows the natural dependency chain: Steam authentication is the prerequisite for everything else, library sync requires an authenticated account, game operations require the library to exist, and branding is applied once the core feature set is complete and ready to ship.

## Milestones

- ✅ **v0.1 Steam Platform** — Phases 1–4 (shipped 2026-06-29) — archive: `milestones/v0.1-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v0.2 Polish & Enhancements** — Phases 5–8.1 (Phase 9 Quality Gate never started) — phase dirs archived 2026-10-16 to `milestones/v0.2-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.3 Humble Bundle Integration** — Phases 10–15 (shipped 2026-07-10) — `milestones/v0.3-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.4 Compatibility Data** — Phase 16 (shipped 2026-07-10) — `milestones/v0.4-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.5 Steam macOS Compatibility Runtime** — Phases 17–19 (shipped 2026-07-14) — `milestones/v0.5-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.6 Aggregated Store Search** — Phase 20 (shipped 2026-07-15) — `milestones/v0.6-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.7 Steam Native Install** — Phases 21, 23–26 (closed 2026-10-16 with live-only UAT PARKED, not verified — see MILESTONES.md; Phase 23's gaps G-23-01/G-23-02 were closed 2026-08-19) — `milestones/v0.7-phases/`
- ✅ **v0.8 Tauri Shell** — Phases 27–50 plus parked Phase 22 (shipped 2026-10-16, **override closeout** — see MILESTONES.md) — archive: `milestones/v0.8-ROADMAP.md` (full phase details, 6008 lines), `milestones/v0.8-phases/`

v0.2–v0.7 were never archived through `/gsd-complete-milestone`; their phase directories (5–26) remain under `.planning/phases/` and their full roadmap entries are preserved verbatim in `milestones/v0.8-ROADMAP.md` lines 238–1051.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

**v0.1 — Steam Platform (Shipped 2026-06-29)**

- [x] **Phase 1: Steam Authentication** - Users can add, manage, and remove Steam accounts in GameLib (completed 2026-06-27)
- [x] **Phase 2: Steam Library** - Steam games appear in the unified library with metadata and install state (completed 2026-06-28)
- [x] **Phase 3: Game Operations** - Users can launch, install, and uninstall Steam games from GameLib (completed 2026-06-28)
- [x] **Phase 4: Branding** - App is identified and distributed as GameLib, not Heroic (completed 2026-06-28)

**v0.2 — Polish & Enhancements**

- [x] **Phase 5: Branding & About Polish** - GameLib presents complete, accurate identity across tray, backend logs, docs, and the release notes link (completed 2026-07-02)
- [x] **Phase 6: Library & Game Status UX** - Library grid surfaces real playtime and install size; a "Playing" badge tracks active Steam sessions (completed 2026-07-03)
- [x] **Phase 7: Game Details Enrichment** - Game details page shows supported platforms and, on macOS, an AppleGamingWiki compatibility rating (completed 2026-07-03, manual UAT pending)
- [x] **Phase 8: New Steam Surfaces** - Steam storefront is browsable in the Stores sidebar tab; Steam games appear in Console mode (completed 2026-07-03)
- [ ] **Phase 9: Quality Gate** - All v0.1 and v0.2 shipped phases pass a formal Nyquist validation pass (no directory — never started)

**v0.3 — Humble Bundle Integration**

- [x] **Phase 10: Humble Auth + Adapter Scaffold** - Users can connect a Humble Bundle account from Manage Accounts with encrypted session persistence and a validated C5 API boundary (completed 2026-07-05)
- [x] **Phase 11: Library Sync + 5-State Key Model** - Full Humble key inventory synced, classified into the 5-state model, and reliably cached with fail-soft behavior (completed 2026-07-06)
- [x] **Phase 12: Ownership Dedup** - Every Humble key cross-referenced against the Steam library; redeemed Steam keys collapse onto their existing Steam library entries (completed 2026-07-06)
- [x] **Phase 13: Keys-Waiting + Giftable-Spares Views** - Users can see claimable keys sorted by expiration urgency and surface gift links for owned-elsewhere spares (5/5 plans executed 2026-07-08; recorded "Gaps found" in the prior progress table — verify gap-closure status against 13-*/13-VALIDATION.md before treating as clean)
- [x] **Phase 14: Guided Claim Flow** - Users safely reveal and activate Humble Steam keys with structural protection against key waste, accidental re-reveal, and rate-limit lockout (completed 2026-07-09)
- [x] **Phase 15: Store Overlay + Expiration Alerts** - Store surfaces show Humble ownership badges; newly-expiring keys trigger OS notifications (completed 2026-07-10; re-verified 10/10 after gap closure — 15-05 CR-01 badge reachability, 15-06 WR-01/WR-02 composite dedup + i18n, follow-up WR-01 divergence fix baac4527; see 15-VERIFICATION.md)

**v0.4 — Compatibility Data**

- [x] **Phase 16: CrossOver Compatibility Rating (CodeWeavers)** - The extra-info Crossover rating comes from live CodeWeavers compatibility data instead of the stale AppleGamingWiki source (completed 2026-07-10)

**v0.5 — Steam macOS Compatibility Runtime**

- [x] **Phase 17: Steam on macOS via CrossOver/Wine** - Windows-only Steam games (no native Mac build) install and launch on macOS through the Windows Steam client running inside a GameLib-managed CrossOver/Wine bottle, instead of native steam:// delegation (all 17 plans executed + UAT approved; completion PAUSED on code-review CR-01 data-loss BLOCKER, closed by gap plan 17-17) (completed 2026-07-13)
- [x] **Phase 18: macOS 32-bit detection, badge & CrossOver routing** - Detects a Steam game's macOS build architecture and routes 32-bit-only mac games to CrossOver/Wine instead of a native install, with an OS/arch badge beside the game logo (completed 2026-07-13, UAT 5/5)
- [x] **Phase 19: CrossOver Compatibility Index (macOS)** - Every game in the library carries a CrossOver medal badge and can be filtered by it, served offline from a CI-built index of CodeWeavers' daily dump instead of a per-game live scrape (completed 2026-07-14)

**v0.6 — Aggregated Store Search**

- [x] **Phase 20: Aggregated Store Search (CheapShark)** - Search a title once and see what it costs across every store, with "you already own this" badges no price-comparison site can show (completed 2026-07-15)

**v0.7 — Steam Native Install**

- [x] **Phase 21: Steam Native Install (depot download)** - Steam games install through an in-process depot download GameLib owns — real progress, real errors, recovery — instead of the opaque steam://rungameid handoff; Steam adopts the install and keeps owning updates (17/17 plans, code-review clean, secure-phase 41/41 threats_open:0; hardware UAT items deferred) (completed 2026-07-20)
- [x] **Phase 23: Steam full-ownership install (StateFlags=4)** — ✅ COMPLETE (2026-08-19) - GameLib authors a StateFlags=4 (FullyInstalled) manifest so Steam does zero verify/download work on first install (COMPLETE — 10/10 plans executed [23-01..23-10]; REQ-23-07 SATISFIED: all three D-07 hardware gates PASS on real macOS 2026-08-19 (Gate 3 interrupt-resume executed for the first time: reconciledSkipped=15643/jobCount=3306, StateFlags 4 not a fail-closed 1026, 21 +x via healReconciledFileModes with zero manual chmod measured BEFORE Steam started, Steam adopted with "Verifying file sizes only"/"Verification complete" in the same second and no re-download, reached main menu, no CrossOver auto-open). G-23-01 stays OPEN BY DECISION, not oversight — its diagnostic is ANSWERED (the official Windows Steam client installed KCD2 in full WITHOUT depot 1771304 and never requested its key), making it a confirmed over-selection + hard-fail defect at severity major whose fix is explicitly out of 23-10's scope and routes to its own gap cycle; its scope now also covers a second divergence, depot 1771306 (13.65GB) which the official client installs and GameLib's plan-build never mentioned. One new defect filed by Gate 3: a resumed install's progress can never reach 100% (measured 76% on a fully successful install). HISTORY: 23-04's SUMMARY written retroactively 2026-08-14, its Task 2 closed via the "failures documented for gap closure" branch. 2026-08-16: G-23-02's root cause CONFIRMED on real macOS as **H2** (23-TRACE.md) — HUMANKIND's manifest carries NO executable flags at all (`distinctFlagValues=[64]`, directories only, both depots), so the writer was applying exactly what it was given and is EXONERATED; the real finding is that `EDepotFileFlag` is not a sufficient source of executability on macOS and a flagless manifest is the NORMAL case (2 of 3 titles censused carry none, while Steam's own install of one of them carries 18,002 of 18,809 `+x`). 23-08 fixed it: fail-closed `allModesApplied` gate (it was vacuously true when zero modes were attempted) plus a load-bearing secondary Mach-O magic-byte fallback that discriminates subtype (MH_EXECUTE/MH_DYLIB yes, MH_BUNDLE no). 23-09 shipped G-23-01's observability half only (dedicated EResult 40 `depotBlocked` branch + failure-site log); selection policy untouched, skip-and-warn gated on 23-10's KCD2 diagnostic. Gate 1's LAUNCH half was downgraded to MASKED (Cyberpunk's manifest is also `executableFlagged=0`, so its recorded launch cannot have run on GameLib-applied bits); its adoption half still stands. REMAINING: 23-10 only — blocking-human, 4 hardware runs (Gate 2 clean re-run, Gate 3 first execution, Gate 1 launch re-confirmation, KCD2 diagnostic). G-23-01/G-23-02 both still `open` in 23-UAT.md, REQ-23-07 stays open, phase NOT verified. BLOCKER IN PATH: a DownloadManager failure does not cancel its own depot download — see `.planning/todos/pending/2026-08-16-orphaned-depot-download-outlives-failure.md`; both HUMANKIND install attempts on 2026-08-16 died on `install did not settle`, so fix that before attempting Gate 2.)
- [x] **Phase 24: macOS native Steam bridge (out-of-process steam_api proxy)** - Out-of-process steam_api shim so bottled Windows-only Steam games run against ONE native macOS Steam client instead of a bottled Windows Steam client per bottle (16/17 plans — 24-10, the human-HW packaged-build acceptance checkpoint, has no SUMMARY.md; Gates 0/1/2/3 PASS on real hardware per 24-UAT.md and gap cycles 24-11..24-17 closed the shim-overwrite/install-poll/launch/sync clusters; Gate 4 (Hoard) explicitly out of scope — bridge proxies only ISteamUser + ISteamFriends; superseded/parked the multi-bottle-families phase, see `## Parked / Superseded Phases`)
- [x] **Phase 25: Steam depot download multi-host fan-out (throughput)** - Raises native-depot download throughput toward Steam-client parity by fanning chunk attempts across multiple healthy CDN hosts instead of one (completed + hardware-verified 2026-07-19: hosts=3, ~10 MiB/s vs 1.5–2.9 MiB/s baseline)
- [x] **Phase 26: Steam Key Redemption** - Users can redeem a loose Steam product key into their own Steam library from inside GameLib via steam-user's redeemKey(), without ever opening the Steam client (completed 2026-07-20)

<details>
<summary>✅ v0.8 Tauri Shell (Phases 27–50, + parked 22) — SHIPPED 2026-10-16 (override closeout: 26 of 45 phases not both complete and verified at close; 429 open artifacts acknowledged, 140 evidence-table rows left open)</summary>

**v0.8 — Tauri Shell** — Rust/Tauri v2 shell + Node sidecar rearchitecture, the incremental IPC port, Windows/Linux/macOS packaging, the Electron cutover, and the post-cutover UI/runner work that followed it.

- [ ] **Phase 22: Steam Game Families (multiple bottle configurations)** — 0/8 plans; ⛔ SUPERSEDED 2026-07-21 by Phase 24 (filed under v0.7 originally; archived with v0.8 by the tool — see `## Parked / Superseded Phases`)
- [x] **Phase 27: Tauri Shell Walking Skeleton** - Rust/Tauri v2 shell + stdio JSON-RPC sidecar + renderer bridge proven end-to-end against the real Steam store-manager code (read flow + launch flow), with a SEAM.md ported-vs-stubbed boundary for the incremental port (completed 2026-07-21, 5/5 plans)
- [x] **Phase 28: Tauri keyring (real safeStorage)** - Swap the plaintext-passthrough stub for spike 011's `keyring` crate path so the sidecar stores its token in the real OS Keychain (keyring-native, not OSCrypt-compatible — see D-01; does NOT unblock Phase 27 UAT 2/3 — see D-03). **Must land before any token-writing channel is wired** (shared store — the stub would silently sign the user out of the real app) (completed 2026-07-22)
- [x] **Phase 29: Tauri store layer** - Grow the sidecar store past the two skeleton stores to cover the ~18 files routing through `electron_store.ts`, so later slices have config to read (completed 2026-07-22)
- [x] **Phase 30: IPC re-plumb slice 1 (install/uninstall/update-check)** - First user-facing domain slice of the ~217 unported endpoints, following SEAM.md's incremental-port checklist (completed 2026-07-22)
- [x] **Phase 31: IPC re-plumb slice 2 (settings/config)** - Settings/config cluster plus the Tauri `dialog` plugin surface those flows need (3 plans executed 2026-07-23; verification gaps_found — gap plan 31-04 added to close CR-01 dialog auto-confirm blocker + WR-01 path-traversal, de-wiring showMessageBox to a safe resolved sentinel ({response:-1}, never rejects) with real multi-button behavior deferred to Phase 33) (completed 2026-07-23)
- [x] **Phase 32: IPC re-plumb slice 3 (downloads/queue)** - Download-manager/queue cluster; exercises the push-notification path at real volume (completed 2026-07-23)
- [x] **Phase 33: Tauri lifecycle cluster** - Real behavior for the 44-file `app`/`dialog`/window/`Notification`/tray/protocol/updater cluster; scope the `session`/`powerSaveBlocker` parity gaps explicitly (completed 2026-07-23)
- [x] **Phase 34: Tauri packaging (Windows/Linux)** — COMPLETE 2026-07-25. Cross-platform builds, signing, notarization, and an auto-update feed pointed at the GameLib fork — 17/17 plans executed (gap cycle 3 all closed: 34-16 closed GAP-A, the macOS codesign-on-empty-secret blocker from live run 30084918812; 34-17 closed GAP-B's code half, pnpm verify:updater-key; 34-18 closed GAP-B's human half via Branch B — regenerated + re-enrolled matched updater keypair, new key id 9A02F7E0C9FC04C7). **Live tag-push gate PASSED (REQ-34-09): run [30123449346](https://github.com/grayson-mitchell/GameLib/actions/runs/30123449346) on commit 006a900a — all 4 legs green, draft+prerelease release with all artifacts + latest.json, macOS+Windows signing gracefully skipped, arm64 SEA sidecar ran Node-free.** Secure-phase DONE (34-SECURITY.md, 42/42 threats closed, threats_open: 0). One build-blocking merge slip fixed en route (paths.ts missing `resolve` import, commit 006a900a).
- [x] **Phase 35: Electron cutover** - Remove the Electron build; the one phase that intentionally breaks the additive/reversible invariant, so it runs last — **✅ GOAL ACHIEVED, 17/17 (2026-09-01).** 29 plans executed incl. gap-closure cycle 1 (35-20..35-29, all 10 complete). Six adjudication passes: 11/17 → 16/17 → 17/17 **rejected** → 16/17 → 16/17 → **17/17**, the sixth being the first verified against a **GENUINE RELEASE ARTIFACT** rather than a debug-packaged one (`F-5-01`: `tauri build --debug` structurally never executes the SEA sidecar, so the earlier identity check had verified an inert artifact; the chain was closed at the RUNNING PROCESS instead — PID 9781 `gamelib-shell` → PID 9787 **bundled** `gamelib-sidecar`, both sha256-identical to that build's outputs). Blocking live gate 21/21 PASS. **`35-VERIFICATION.md` stays `status: human_needed` BY DESIGN, not as a default** — 7 human items remain, and `gaps_found` would make the phase vanish from `audit-uat` entirely, taking criterion 14's genuinely-open UI-repaint item with it. **Three records blockers CLOSED 2026-09-01 by quick `260901-vuy`** (no code, no gesture): the `35-LIVE-GATE.md` writeback, the Phase 38 inheritance now ledgered as `38-W06`, and REQ-35-07 deconditioned from `D-35-19-15`. **STILL OPEN, do NOT read as closed:** `D-35-19-15` (unreproducible by construction — `b5b3464bd` removed the window that seeded the sibling apexes; the domain-*suffix* half IS exercised, the four sibling apexes are not), criterion 14's unobserved repaint, criterion 10's AppleEvent path. **Routed out:** `pnpm lint` → Phase 39; Windows/Linux and off-macOS Epic logout → Phase 38.

## Parked / Superseded Phases

### Phase 22: Steam Game Families (multiple bottle configurations)

**Status:** ⛔ SUPERSEDED 2026-07-21 by Phase 24 (permanent — will not be unparked). See `.planning/milestones/v0.8-phases/22-multiple-steam-bottles/PARKED.md` (moved there by the v0.8 archive on 2026-10-16) and commit `b40aa6d8`.
**Plans:** 8 written, 0 executed — all artifacts retained, nothing deleted.

**Why:** Phase 22 existed to let a user group macOS Steam games into "families," each backed by its own dedicated CrossOver bottle with its own Steam client/login/Wine version, working around the fact that the Phase 17 single-bottle foundation shared one bottle for every macOS Steam game. Phase 24 shipped a native `steam_api` proxy instead: a drop-in shim in a single shared bridge bottle talks out-of-process to the real native macOS Steam client. For a bridge-routed game there is no bottled Windows Steam client to configure per family, so the per-family bottle matrix Phase 22 was designed to manage has nothing to manage on that path. **That path is narrow, though (corrected 2026-10-16):** `isBridgeEligible()` (`steam/games.ts`) requires membership of `bridge/bridge-allowlist.json`, which holds two games (Avernum 5 and 6). Every other bottle-eligible macOS Steam game still falls through to the Phase 17 path — the Windows Steam client inside the one shared `GameLibSteam` bottle — so the single-bottle limitation Phase 22 addressed is still live for nearly the whole bottled library. The bridge itself also uses one shared bottle (`DEFAULT_BRIDGE_BOTTLE_NAME`); that was a planning choice in `24-04-PLAN.md` that stretched D-03 (one shared helper *process*) to the bottle, not an operator decision. The supersession stands because the intended fix is to widen the bridge and give bridge games their own bottles, not to multiply Steam-client bottles; see todos `2026-10-16-widen-the-native-steam-bridge-beyond-two-games` and `2026-10-16-bridge-games-should-each-get-their-own-bottle`. This was anticipated: the bridge was already recorded in STATE.md as "Phase 22's preferred successor" before Phase 24 was executed.

**Goal (as originally scoped, never executed):** Let a user group macOS Steam games into "families" — each family backed by its own dedicated CrossOver bottle with its own Steam client, login, and Wine/CrossOver version — so games that need a different configuration can get one, instead of every macOS Steam game sharing the single Phase 17 bottle.
**Depends on (as scoped):** Phase 17 (dedicated Steam bottle foundation) and Phase 18 (bottle-eligibility routing). Independent of the Phase 20/21 lines.
**Requirements**: TBD (never minted — SPEC.md never locked)

**Plans (unexecuted):**

- [ ] 22-01-PLAN.md — Reshape SteamBottleConfig → families/assignments + thread explicit bottleName through bottle.ts primitives
- [ ] 22-02-PLAN.md — families.ts service: zero-loss migration, CRUD, resolveFamilyForApp, naming rules
- [ ] 22-03-PLAN.md — Cross-family ACF reconciliation + poller: scan all families, tag bottleName
- [ ] 22-04-PLAN.md — Resolver-first routing in games.ts across all four bottle-eligible methods
- [ ] 22-05-PLAN.md — Fold single-bottle IPC into the family group + wire startup migration
- [ ] 22-06-PLAN.md — Parameterize the guided-setup store/component by bottleName
- [ ] 22-07-PLAN.md — Install-time family picker + gate both install chokepoints
- [ ] 22-08-PLAN.md — "Steam Families" Settings section: create/rename/set-wine/guarded delete

**Not revivable — salvage means a NEW phase:** this phase is permanently superseded and will not be executed. The parts that could still have value are the ones *not* about bottle multiplicity — chiefly any per-game launch-configuration UI and the Steam game-families data model itself. If either is wanted, scope it as a new phase derived against the bridge architecture; do not resume these plans. Bridge scope limits that might reopen adjacent work are tracked in Phase 24's own artifacts (`24-UAT.md`, `24-SECURITY.md`) and the `spike-findings-gamelib` skill — notably that the bridge currently proxies only ISteamUser + ISteamFriends, so games needing more interfaces (Utils/Apps/UserStats/RemoteStorage/Matchmaking/Networking) are out of scope until those proxies are built.

## Backlog

No items. Phase 999.1 (cross-store signed-out / offline mode) was promoted to Phase 49 on
2026-10-08; its full text now lives under that entry.

**Adjacent, deliberately NOT folded in:** confirming that `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`,
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` and `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` are enrolled as repo secrets — without
them `.github/workflows/release-tauri.yml` ships unsigned, giving each release a fresh code
identity so the macOS Keychain ACL never matches and users get re-prompted on every update. That
is the actual lever on prompt *quantity*, it is independent of this phase, and it should not wait
on it.

### Phase 51: Widen the native Steam bridge — more interface proxies, scan-derived eligibility

**Goal:** Most Windows-only Steam games on macOS run through the Phase 24 bridge in their own
per-game bottle, and the shared Phase 17 `GameLibSteam` bottled-Steam bottle becomes the fallback
for a measured residue instead of the default. Today `isBridgeEligible()` (`steam/games.ts:2001`)
requires membership in `bridge/bridge-allowlist.json`, which holds two games (Avernum 5 and 6), so
every other bottle-eligible title shares one Windows Steam client and one set of CrossOver tweaks.
Filed 2026-10-17 from the operator design question of 2026-10-16, closing
`.planning/todos/completed/2026-10-16-widen-the-native-steam-bridge-beyond-two-games.md`.
Per-game bridge bottles already ship (quick `261016-u1w`, live-gated 5/5 by `261016-wsq`), so the
bottle half of the question is answered; this phase is the interface half and the eligibility half.

**Three sub-decisions are LOCKED inputs to the spec, made from the Phase 24 record:**

1. **Interface order is the Hoard set, in this order:** ISteamUtils, ISteamApps, ISteamUserStats
   first (near-universal, mostly read-only or safely stubbable), ISteamRemoteStorage second (answer
   as cloud-disabled), ISteamMatchmaking and ISteamNetworking last (answer unavailable; P2P join
   stays out of scope as 24-SPEC ruled). The evidence is D-UAT-24-09: Hoard loaded the shim, ran,
   and died on the first unimplemented accessor (`SteamUtils`) because `steam_api.def` exports only
   the lifecycle set plus `SteamAPI_SteamUser_v023` and `SteamAPI_SteamFriends_v018`. The export
   table must also grow the bare legacy accessors (`SteamUser()`, `SteamUtils()`, …) Hoard imports
   and whatever the `SteamInternal_*` / `SteamAPI_GetHSteamUser` / `SteamClient()` family modern
   SDKs route through — research must census that family against real owned titles, it is not in
   any spike. Acceptance is 24-UAT Gate 4 re-run: Hoard (63000) playable through the bridge.
2. **Eligibility becomes scan-derived, not hand-curated.** The install-time coverage check already
   exists (`bridge/shimGenerate.ts:239`, `scanSteamApiImports` → rejected placement on any uncovered
   symbol); today its verdict is thrown away after one launch failure. This phase persists it per
   game in `steamMetadataStore` on the D-17 `forcedWindowsViaBottle` precedent, and a bottle-eligible
   game that is NOT allowlisted installs into a per-game bridge bottle, is scanned, and either runs
   through the bridge or gets the D-05 dialog naming the missing symbols and offering the
   bottled-Steam fallback. The scan can only run after the exe exists, so the phase accepts
   install-first-decide-second; the spec must settle whether the depot manifest's file list
   (`steam_api.dll` vs `steam_api64.dll`) gives a cheap pre-install screen.
3. **The allowlist stays bundled JSON; no remote CI index.** D-01 named the Phase 19 index as the
   upgrade path, but there is nothing to index without owning the games. The JSON becomes a seed of
   known-good titles plus a known-bad list (DRM-wrapped, 24-SPEC out-of-scope); growth is the
   persisted scan verdict above.

**Two hazards the spec must carry, both measured at filing:** (a) the shim is PE32 i386 and
`importScan.ts` matches only the `steam_api.dll` heading, so a 64-bit game scans as importing
nothing and placement passes vacuously — the game then loads a `steam_api64.dll` that does not
exist. Any scan-derived eligibility must fail closed on a `steam_api64.dll` import, and whether a
64-bit shim target (`zig cc -target x86_64-windows-gnu`, single Win64 calling convention) is in
scope decides whether "most" is reachable at all; research it before the spec, do not assume
either way. (b) Until this lands, the documented stopgap for the shared bottle is per-executable
Wine overrides (`HKCU\Software\Wine\AppDefaults\<game>.exe`), which need no second bottle.

**Requirements**: TBD (run `/gsd-spec-phase 51` or `/gsd-discuss-phase 51` to mint; the three
sub-decisions above are locked, the two hazards are open questions for research).
**Depends on:** Phase 24 (the generator `meta/gen_vtables.ts`, the helper
`native/steam-bridge/helper/bridge_helper.c`, the wire frame both share, and the `bridge/` routing
in `games.ts`) and quick task `261016-u1w` (per-game bridge bottles). **Not** Phase 50, which
`phase.add` wrote by positional guess — the Epic subview shares no files with this.
