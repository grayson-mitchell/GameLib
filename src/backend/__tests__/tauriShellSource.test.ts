/**
 * Phase 34 gap-closure suite (Plan 34-10) covering code-review findings WR-01 and WR-03
 * against `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. This extends the Wave-0 config-shape convention
 * (cargoFeatures.test.ts, tauriConf.test.ts) to the Rust shell source itself.
 *
 * WR-01: `use_dev_sidecar()` must not have a release-reachable env-var escape hatch into
 * `Command::new("node")` — it must reduce to `cfg!(debug_assertions)` alone.
 * WR-03: the sidecar child process must be explicitly killed and reaped on app exit
 * (`RunEvent::Exit`), not just held alive via an unused `_child` field.
 *
 * All assertions run against a COMMENT-STRIPPED copy of the source. main.rs's doc comments
 * quote the exact strings under assertion (e.g. the WR-01 doc comment literally contains
 * "GAMELIB_SIDECAR_ENTRY", and the WR-03 field comment contains "the child is not reaped"),
 * so an unfiltered grep/match would be self-satisfying and could pass on prose alone even if
 * the real code never changed.
